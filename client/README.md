Python client implementation for utilizing the Notikums API
===========================================================

How to run the client:
----------------------
The client can be run from the command line with python
```
# create and use a virtual env (recommended)
# install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
python client.py
```
All of the settings  for the client are currently hard-coded in the same `client.py` in which the logic of the client is. (Future improvement would be to make these easily configurable)

How to use the client:
-------------------------------
All of the instructions for using the client are provided inside the client's cli.
> Some methods might not YET be implemented, those ones are documented in the client's code.
